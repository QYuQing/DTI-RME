# DTI-RME

DTI-RME: A Robust and Multi-Kernel Ensemble Approach for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction

MATLAB Version: R2018b

📁 Project Structure

main.m: Main script to run the DTI-RME model.

datasets/: Directory containing the datasets for training and testing.

🚀 How to Run the Program

Ensure dataset files are placed correctly under datasets/, with the same format used in the original experiments.

In the MATLAB command window, run:

main.m

The script will output predicted drug-target interaction scores.

Check AUC,AUPR results printed at the end to compare with those reported in the paper.
